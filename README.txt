AdviseMe is a recommendation service developed for the university graduation project.
This service has my original design (PUG, SCSS, GULP) and recommendations module. I am using tmdb_v3-PHP-API library to get info about movies from themoviedb.org and IMDBBot class to get rating from OMDB.
The project is not perfect and needs work to do but can be used as Wordpress theme with MySQL connection.
